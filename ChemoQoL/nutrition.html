        <h1>Nutrition for Cancer Patients</h1>
        <p>When undergoing chemotherapy, cancer patients may have specific nutrition needs. Here are some recommendations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Eat frequent, small meals throughout the day to prevent nausea and vomiting.</li>
          <li>Choose soft, easy-to-digest foods if you experience mouth sores or digestive issues.</li>
          <li>Get plenty of protein to help repair and regenerate cells damaged by chemotherapy.</li>
          <li>Consider taking supplements or vitamins to address any nutrient deficiencies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These recommendations are based on the fact that chemotherapy can cause side effects that affect a patient's ability to eat and absorb nutrients, so it's important to work with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian to ensure proper nutrition during treatment.</p>
