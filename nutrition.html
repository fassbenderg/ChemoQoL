        <h1>Healthy Diet Recommendations</h1>
        <p>A healthy diet is important for everyone, but especially for those undergoing chemotherapy. Here are some general recommendations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables for essential vitamins and minerals.</strong>
            <p>Vegetables and fruits contain essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that are important for overall health. They can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including cancer, and support the immune system.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose lean protein sources such as fish, poultry, and legumes.</strong>
            <p>Protein is important for repairing and building tissues and cells. Lean protein sources are lower in saturated and trans fats, which can increase inflammation in the body and may contribute to cancer risk.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limit saturated and trans fats, which can increase inflammation in the body.</strong>
            <p>Saturated and trans fats can increase inflammation in the body, which can contribute to the development and progression of chronic diseases, including cancer. Choose healthy fats such as those found in nuts, seeds, and fatty fish.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose whole grains over refined grains for more fiber and nutrients.</strong>
            <p>Whole grains are an important source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They can help regulate blood sugar levels, reduce the risk of heart disease and some cancers, and support digestive health.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and avoiding sugary drinks.</strong>
            <p>Drinking plenty of water is important for overall health and can help prevent dehydration. Sugary drinks, on the other hand, can contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of chronic diseases, including cancer.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These recommendations are based on the fact that a healthy diet can help boost the immune system, which is important for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p>

          </li>
          <li>Include foods rich in antioxidants to help reduce inflammation in the body.

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These recommendations are based on the fact that chemotherapy can cause side effects that affect a patient's ability to eat and absorb nutrients, so it's important to work with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian to ensure proper nutrition during treatment.</p>
